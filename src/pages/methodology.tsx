                ACEs are also associated with behaviors such as smoking,
                alcoholism and drug abuse, as well as lower graduation rates and
                academic achievement.

                Grounded is focusing on helping people acknowledge the effects

                through art and mindfulness.

              Helping students and young people acknowledge their inner voice

              By listening to their interests and passions, we help students
              affected by ACEs to develop a new awareness in themselves, their
              decisions, their futures and communities.

              When students pay attention to their passions and have an elevated

              We create a feeling of community and use it to develop unity,

              Self awareness and a sense of community work to change the actions
              and relationships in the students' communities. As students change
              through mindfulness and self-expression, there are pronounced
              shifts in the culture around them and their day-to-day lives.
